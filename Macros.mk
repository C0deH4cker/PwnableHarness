# Naming convention for macros declared here:
#
# Macros named with a leading underscore must be eval-ed after calling them,
# whereas those without a leading underscore do not. Whenever a macro that
# requires eval-ing is defined, both macros with and without the leading
# underscore are defined, where the one without is defined as eval-ing the
# underscore-prefixed version.
#
# For example, macro named _make_rule must be called using:
# $(eval $(call _make_rule,args...))
# whereas a macro named make_rule must be called using:
# $(call make_rule,args)
# Also, when both forms are present, make_rule is defined like so:
# make_rule = $(eval $(call _make_rule,args...))
# In this way, _make_rule is recursively expanded in the call context and
# therefore has access to the parameter variables $1, $2, etc that come
# from calling make_rule.
#
# Because the only difference between the two forms is that the one without
# the leading underscore is eval-ed, when defining such a macro that needs
# to call other macros, call the non-eval-ed version. That prevents double
# evaluation, since otherwise the macro will be evaluated when it is called
# and again when the calling macro is eval-ed.
