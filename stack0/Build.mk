# A Build.mk file can contain directory-specific variables such as
# TARGET as well as target-specific variables like stack0_CFLAGS.
# A bare minimum Build.mk file defines only TARGET.
#
# The build system defines the variable DIR to be the path to the
# directory containing Build.mk so it can be used to refer to files.
# This variable is useful because the actual current working directory
# of the build system is always at the top-level.


## Directory-specific variables

# TARGET is the name of the executable to build. If more than one
# target should be built, TARGETS should be set instead of TARGET.
# TARGET and TARGETS are actually handled in exactly the same way
# by the build system, but they both exist for user preference.
#
# Note: It is an error to define both TARGET and TARGETS.
TARGET := stack0


## Target-specific variables: Each of the following variables of the
# format target_VAR are specific to that target. If the variable is
# set without the target prefix, it will be applied to every target
# defined in this file unless a target defines the version with the
# target prefix, in which case only that target will use its own.
#
# For example, in the following example, both slowpoke and lethargic
# will be built with -O0, while gottagofast will be built with -O3.
#
# TARGETS := slowpoke lethargic gottagofast
# OFLAGS := -O0 -DSPEED=not_fast
# gottagofast_OFLAGS := -O3 -DSPEED=fast


# These are the other target-specific variables may be defined here
# to override their defaults:
#
# target_CFLAGS:   Command line options passed to CC when compiling
#                  C source files.
#                  Default: empty
#
# target_LDFLAGS:  Command line options passed to LD when linking the
#                  TARGET executable.
#                  Default: empty
#
# target_OFLAGS:   Command line options passed to CC to control the
#                  compiler's optimization settings.
#                  Default: -O0
#
# target_NX:       Define this to enable NX aka DEP aka W^X.
#                  Default: empty
#
# target_ASLR:     Define this to enable ASLR.
#                  Default: empty
#
# target_CANARY:   Define this to enable stack protector canaries.
#                  Default: empty
#
# target_RELRO:    Define this to enable full RELRO. This can be set
#                  to "partial" to enable partial RELRO, which is the
#                  default in GCC.
#                  Default: empty
#
# target_BITS:     Either 32 or 64, for deciding the architecture to
#                  build for (i386/amd64).
#                  Default: 32
#
# target_CXXFLAGS: Command line options passed to CXX when compiling
#                  C++ source files.
#                  Default: empty
#
# target_LDLIBS:   Command line options passed to LD when linking the
#                  TARGET executable, used specifically to list the
#                  libraries to link against.
#                  Default: -lpwnableharness$(target_BITS).so
#
# target_SRCS:     List of source files belonging to the TARGET.
#                  Default: Every file matching *.c or *.cpp in the
#                  same directory as Build.mk.
#
# target_CC:       Compiler to use for C sources.
#                  Default: gcc
#
# target_CXX:      Compiler to use for C++ sources.
#                  Default: g++
#
# target_LD:       Linker to use.
#                  Default: target_CXX if there are any C++ source
#                  files in target_SRCS, otherwise target_CC.
